## Licensing & Usage

**Ultimate Music Box – Collection 2** is a delightful music box experience featuring 12 fantastic classical melodies. Each collection invites a ballerina to twirl gently as the music plays. Users may select a single melody or loop playback using the dropdown menu on the main screen. There is also a play all feature.

## Build Ritual & Recovery Guidance

During first compile or when opening Form Designer, you may encounter the following error:

> **Error**: A numeric comparison was attempted on `$(MsBuildMajorVersion)` that evaluates to `""` instead of a number, in condition `($(MsBuildMajorVersion) < 16)`.

This occurs when required packages are not yet restored, especially after a fresh clone or migration. To resolve:

- If prompted, click **No** to continue, then go to **Build → Rebuild Solution**
- Alternatively, **Compile once**, then **Close and reopen Visual Studio**, and proceed to **Form Designer View**

This is a known ritual misstep and does not affect the emotional integrity of the Music Box. Once resolved, the ballerina will spin freely, and the wind-down sound will signal ceremonial closure.

## Emotional Purpose

This Music Box is designed for autistic users to relax and unwind. It is not a learning tool, but a sensory sanctuary — a place of calm, predictability, and emotional safety. The spinning ballerina and the final wind-down sound are ceremonial signals of peace and completion.

Future learning editions may include licensing modules for deployment in Autistic Centres and Schools. These are preserved but dormant, and not part of the current collection.
